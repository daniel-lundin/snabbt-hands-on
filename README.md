## Experiment 1 - Feeback buttons

Create buttons with click handlers that will give a feedback effect when clicked.

Examples:

 - Scale down to 0.8 and then back to 1
 - Rotate around Z-axis
 - Rotate around the bottom edge of the button

## Experiment 2 - Text appear

Place some random text in a div. Create a button that will make the words appear one at a time with an animation of your choice.

Note: Each word has to be in it's own element, so either wrap each element in a span tag or use the library blast.js to do this automatically. (bower install blast)
Note: Inline elements can not be transformed, use display: inline-block

##  Experminet 3 - Demo competition

Create a cool demo.
